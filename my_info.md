# Ahmed Abdellahi Abdat

## About Me
Passionate about web development and new technologies, I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Electronics, Electrotechnics, and Automation. I have a strong background in React.js and Next.js, demonstrated by projects such as "Eco-City," a hackathon-award-winning urban issues reporting application, and a WhatsApp clone messaging web app. I excel in building complex and interactive web applications and thrive in dynamic teams working on challenging projects that provide real value.

In addition to my technical expertise, I am the founder of a web and mobile development agency, have experience in full-stack development, and am currently exploring React Native and MongoDB to further enhance my skill set.
